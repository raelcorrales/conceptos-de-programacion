    "# LongestPassword\n",
    "\n",
    "You would like to set a password for a bank account. However, there are three restrictions on the format of the password:\n",
    "\n",
    "- it has to contain only alphanumerical characters (`a−z`, `A−Z`, `0−9`);\n",
    "- there should be an even number of letters;\n",
    "- there should be an odd number of digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a string S consisting of N characters. String S can be divided into words by splitting it at, and removing, the spaces. The goal is to choose the longest word that is a valid password. You can assume that if there are K spaces in string S then there are exactly K + 1 words.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given \"`test 5 a0A pass007 ?xy1`\", there are five words and three of them are valid passwords: \"`5`\", \"`a0A`\" and \"`pass007`\". Thus the longest password is \"`pass007`\" and its length is 7. Note that neither \"`test`\" nor \"`?xy1`\" is a valid password, because \"`?`\" is not an alphanumerical character and \"`test`\" contains an even number of digits (zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def solution(S)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "that, given a non-empty string S consisting of N characters, returns the length of the longest word from the string that is a valid password. If there is no such word, your function should return −1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given S = \"test 5 a0A pass007 ?xy1\", your function should return 7, as explained above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that:\n",
    "\n",
    "N is an integer within the range [1..200];\n",
    "string S consists only of printable ASCII characters and spaces.\n",
    "In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment."
