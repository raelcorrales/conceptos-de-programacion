    "# Parking Bill\n",
    "You parked your car in a parking lot and want to compute the total cost of the ticket. The billing rules are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The entrance fee of the car parking lot is 2;\n",
    "The first full or partial hour costs 3;\n",
    "Each successive full or partial hour (after the first) costs 4.\n",
    "You entered the car parking lot at time E and left at time L. In this task, times are represented as strings in the format **\"HH:MM\"** (where \"HH\" is a two-digit number between 0 and 23, which stands for hours, and \"MM\" is a two-digit number between 0 and 59, which stands for minutes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def solution(E, L)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "that, given strings E and L specifying points in time in the format **\"HH:MM\"**, returns the total cost of the parking bill from your entry at time E to your exit at time L. You can assume that E describes a time before L on the same day.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given **\"10:00\"** and **\"13:21\"** your function should return 17, because the entrance fee equals 2, the first hour costs 3 and there are two more full hours and part of a further hour, so the total cost is 2 + 3 + (3 * 4) = 17. Given **\"09:42\"** and **\"11:42\"** your function should return 9, because the entrance fee equals 2, the first hour costs 3 and the second hour costs 4, so the total cost is 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that:\n",
    "\n",
    "strings E and L follow the format **\"HH:MM\"** strictly;\n",
    "string E describes a time before L on the same day.\n",
    "In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.\n"
